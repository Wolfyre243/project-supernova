# Project Supernova Product Description

## Why It Exists

Project Supernova exists to simplify personal finance for everyday users,
particularly those new to budgeting or overwhelmed by complex financial tools.
It aims to make money management approachable, encouraging users to build
healthy financial habits without requiring advanced financial knowledge.

## Problems Being Solved

- **Lack of Financial Clarity**: Many users struggle to understand where their
  money goes each month due to scattered spending and no clear overview.
- **Budgeting Complexity**: Existing tools often overwhelm beginners with jargon
  or excessive features, discouraging consistent use.
- **Motivation Gaps**: Users lose momentum in sticking to budgets without clear,
  encouraging feedback or achievable milestones.
- **Time-Consuming Tracking**: Manual expense logging is tedious, leading to
  inconsistent tracking and incomplete data.

to:

  transportation, entertainment) with customizable limits based on income or
  goals.
- **Log Expenses Quickly**: Add transactions in seconds via a mobile-friendly
  interface, supporting manual entry or potential future integrations like
  receipt scanning.
- **Visualize Spending**: View clear, interactive charts showing spending by
  category, trends over time, and progress toward budget goals.
- **Receive Actionable Insights**: Get simple, jargon-free alerts (e.g., "You're
  close to overspending on dining") and weekly/monthly summaries highlighting
  achievements or areas to adjust.
- **Track Savings Goals**: Set specific objectives (e.g., "Save $500 for a
  laptop") with progress bars to maintain motivation.
