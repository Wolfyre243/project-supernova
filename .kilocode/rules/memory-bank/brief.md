# Project Supernova Brief

## Overview

Building a NextJS PWA web app for personal finance tracking with budgeting and
spending tracking features. The app aims to provide users with a simple,
intuitive interface to manage their finances, set budgets, and monitor spending
habits.

## Core Requirements

- **User Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login using Supabase Auth.
- **Budget Management**: Allow users to create, edit, and delete budgets for
  different categories (e.g., groceries, utilities).
- **Spending Tracking**: Enable users to log transactions manually and
  categorize them under predefined or custom categories.
- **Dashboard**: Display an overview of budgets, recent transactions, and
  spending trends using charts.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app is fully functional and visually
  appealing on both desktop and mobile devices using React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Type Safety**: Implement TypeScript for robust type checking and improved
  developer experience.

## Goals

- Provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for managing personal
  finances.
- Ensure data security and privacy through Supabase's authentication.
- Deliver a scalable and maintainable codebase using NextJS and TypeScript.
- Enable future integrations, such as connecting to bank APIs for automated
  transaction imports (post-MVP).
